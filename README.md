# File-Organizer-Automation-File-Project
When you run the file organizer script, it begins by telling you which folder it will organize. For each file inside that folder, it checks what type it is—like a document, image, or video—and moves it into a new subfolder according to its type. If the script finds files it doesn’t recognize or can’t categorize, it moves them to a folder called “Others”.​

The script skips over hidden files and existing folders, focusing only on regular files. When it finishes, it gives you a clear summary: how many files it moved, and how many it skipped. If you choose the preview mode before organizing, the script simply lists out where every file would go, so you can review and make sure it’ll do what you expect before any changes are made. This helps keep your files neat and easy to find, with full transparency about what’s happening at every step.
